Hello BOON here, these are all of Wally's sprites for you to start editing, you'll want a pixel based
editing program such as aseprite or pyxeledit and import these sprites as a spritesheet. 

The resolutions for the sprites, please make sure your new sprites resolution match the resolution of the original.

IMPORTANT!

When adding a cape to your character please make sure that you have a file that is the cape ONLY with 
the same name, this will allow your character to have different cape colors with each combo with the 
RAINBOW cape powerup.

If you want to change the color of the cape from red to another color, please make sure to also change
the red color under palette files under \mods\Wally\palette\s_player_cape_palette.png to the color that you want.




Thank you 
-BOON
